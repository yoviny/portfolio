Each Bengali grapheme can be seperated into the three constituent elements: grapheme root, vowel diacritics, and consonant diacritics. There are roughly 10,000 possible graphemes and the goal was to implement a robust deep learning model that will enable OCR for handrwritten Bengali samples. The competiton was hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment) by [Bengali.AI](https://bengali.ai/).
