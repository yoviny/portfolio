- Designed an imaging system capable of capturing images in multiple wavelengths by developing the electronic design and program code.
- Utilized image processing for multispectral image analysis to identify latent stress fractures in wind turbine blades, optimizing maintenance and repair scheduling.
- Enhanced lab experiment efficiency by employing ML classifiers for microbial colony detection and segmentation, facilitating precise surface area calculations.
- Developed a drone based on opensource hardware to match unique requirements of the research project.
- Designed PCBâ€™s using Eagle PCB and performed circuit simulations in Orcad.
- Developed a computer vision-based 3D printing monitor that detects print failures, effectively reducing material waste.
- Reduced 3D print failures up to 40% by upgrading existing 3D printer with new hardware and re-programming based on opensource firmware.
- Overcame software and electronic related errors in projects at JKR by troubleshooting and debugging.
- Identified and procured equipment and components required for the project and performed prior art searches related to the research project.
- Contributed to team brainstorming for innovative, marketable ideas by conducting prior art searches, validating concepts through proof-of-concept product development, and fostering potential intellectual property creation.
